# Deep Learning course - 1st Practical

## In this project, a comparison of three Deep Learning architectures is conducted. These architectures consist of Xception, ResNet50V2 and DenseNet201. Their performance is evaluated using the validation accuracy metric. These architectures are combined with RMSProp and Adam optimizers to test for optimization effects as well as augmentation technique to test for regularization effects
