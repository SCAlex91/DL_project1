# Deep Learning course - 1st Practical

## This project is concerned with the examination and comparison of deep learning architectures such as DenseNet201, Xception and ResNet50V2 with different settings, hyperparameters, optimizers and regularization techniques. We use transfer learning of the pre-trained models on the ImageNet dataset and perform a binary classification task on the image dataset of cats versus dogs. We evaluate the performance of all the tested models based on the validation accuracy metric.
